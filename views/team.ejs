            <h1>Dr. KAY SHEEHAN,<br>
                 MSW, LCSW,<br> ED.D</h1>

                 <img class="team-firstpix" src="/img/a8.jpg">

            <p>Dr. Kay Sheehan is both a licensed clinical social worker (BA, double major: Psychology and Sociology and MSW,
                University of Minnesota) and also holds her doctorate in Transpersonal Psychology (University of Northern
                Colorado). She has been practicing over thirty-five years and does individual therapy, family therapy and
                marriage/couple therapy, power struggle resolution, neurofeedback and biofeedback training. She likes to have a
                more general practice, because it is more interesting to her, and does have because of two areas of real specialty.
                    One area is that of Applied Psychophysiology and Biofeedback/Neurofeedback Therapy. She has been working in
this area for over thirty-five years and is one of the founders of the Colorado Association for Applied
Psychophysiology and Biofeedback, a past president twice and has held many board positions. She also was a
board member of the national/international Association for Applied Psychophysiology and Biofeedback and gives
talks and workshops to other professionals both nationally and internationally, most recently on Traumatic Brain
Injuries (TBI).
                
                
                    The second area of specialty is Power Struggle Resolution. Her doctoral dissertation was the only
psychotherapeutic model of power struggle resolution in the international literature. The psychotherapeutic
model of power struggle resolution she created is for the resolution of power struggles between parents and
children/adolescents, between adults, and in the work place, where a power struggle is often euphemistically
referred to as a “personality conflict.” She is finishing her book on the resolution of power struggles.

                <p>
                    These two areas dovetail in terms of control issues, the applied psychophysiology and biofeedback deals with inner
control issues and the power struggle resolution deals with external control issues. Control issues are the bottom
line issue for any problem whether it is an individual issue or a relationship issue and hence, how she is able to
maintain a more general practice. She has several subspecialties because of these two areas of expertise, among
them are: ADHD, learning difficulties, Traumatic Brain Injuries, bipolar disorder, chronic depression, anxiety,
phobias, obsessive compulsive disorder, PTSD, autism, reactive attachment disorder, Asperger’s, addictions and
stress related disorders.
                
                
                    In addition to extensive clinical practice, Dr. Sheehan is very knowledgeable in the area of learning disabilities,
weaknesses and learning styles of both children/adolescents and adults, having been on the Special Services Team
of the Littleton Public School District and as the Staffing Chairperson.
                
                
                    Dr. Sheehan is also a former Assistant Professor at Metropolitan State University (formerly Metropolitan State
College) in the Department of Human Services. She continued as a professor until her private practice became full
time. She continues to teach and present workshops.

                <p>
                    In addition to being certified at the highest level in Biofeedback from the only recognized certifying organization,
Board Certification International Alliance (BCIA), as a Senior Fellow, she is also Board Certified in Neurofeedback.
                
                
                    Dr. Sheehan is also certified at the highest level for EMDR, a psychotherapeutic technique that speeds
psychotherapy up by many sessions and is excellent for traumatic events and for habits and patterns in which the
individual knows one thing cognitively, but is still stuck emotionally and behaviorally.
                
                
                    In addition to speaking and giving workshops nationally and internationally, she has served as a member of
various professional boards, such as the Rocky Mountain Tourette Syndrome Association.
